      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alamparelli/blog/refs/heads/master/content/posts/welcome.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Welcome&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I have a ton of ideas swirling around, and I’ve had to make some choices about what to prioritize with my current schedule. My goal is to create a portfolio site with a unique design, along with a blog space. But since I&amp;rsquo;m busy working on my next project, I’ve decided to start with this temporary blog, which you’re seeing here in this first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt essential to have a space where I can continue sharing my thoughts and keep you updated on my upcoming projects. I value this blog a lot—not only for myself (I might be the only reader for now!) but also for you, future visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to leave a message or follow me on social media so we can share and connect around all the exciting things currently in progress. This blog will be a space for ideas and connections, where I hope to build something meaningful with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to subscribe to the RSS feed or leave me a message via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://portfolio.lamparelli.eu/contact&#34;&gt;portfolio website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
