Right now, I have a ton of ideas swirling around, and I’ve had to make some choices about what to prioritize with my current schedule. My goal is to create a portfolio site with a unique design, along with a blog space. But since I'm busy working on my next project, I’ve decided to start with this temporary blog, which you’re seeing here in this first post.

It felt essential to have a space where I can continue sharing my thoughts and keep you updated on my upcoming projects. I value this blog a lot—not only for myself (I might be the only reader for now!) but also for you, future visitors.

Don't hesitate to subscribe to the RSS feed or leave me a message via the [portfolio website](https://portfolio.lamparelli.eu/contact) so we can share and connect around all the exciting things currently in progress. This blog will be a space for ideas and connections, where I hope to build something meaningful with you.
